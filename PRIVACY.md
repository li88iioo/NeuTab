NeuTab is a browser new tab extension. This extension does not collect, sell, or share personal information.

## Data We Use

NeuTab stores your settings and shortcut data locally in your browser (using the browser extension storage). This data never leaves your device unless you choose to sync it through your own browser account (e.g., Chrome/Edge sync), which is controlled by the browser vendor.

If enabled, NeuTab can read the following browser data **locally** to build optional dynamic groups:

- **Top Sites** (for frequently visited sites)
- **History** (for recently visited sites)
- **Bookmarks** (for quick search and management)

These permissions are only used to render your new tab content on-device and are never transmitted to any external server by NeuTab.

## Network Requests

NeuTab only sends network requests when you click a search engine or open a website. Search queries are sent directly to the search engine you select.

For site icons, NeuTab uses the browser's built-in favicon API. On Chromium-based browsers, this may involve requests to Google's favicon service. On Firefox, favicons are fetched directly from the site's `/favicon.ico`. NeuTab itself does not make direct requests to third-party favicon services.

## Data Sharing

NeuTab does not transmit your data to any server. There is no analytics, tracking, or advertising SDK included.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, open an issue in this repository.
